# 4-bit-full-adder-implementation
This is a 4-bit full adder developed using verilog HDL and implemented in the Basys 3 Artix-7 FPGA board

The verilog code was developed on the Xilinx Vivado Design Suite and the results were simulated to test the 4-bit full adder circuit. In order to implement the design on the Basys 3 Artix-7 FPGA board, the bitstream for the design was generated.
